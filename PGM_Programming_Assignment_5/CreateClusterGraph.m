%CREATECLUSTERGRAPH Takes in a list of factors and returns a Bethe cluster
%   graph. It also returns an assignment of factors to cliques.
%
%   C = CREATECLUSTERGRAPH(F) Takes a list of factors and creates a Bethe
%   cluster graph with nodes representing single variable clusters and
%   pairwise clusters. The value of the clusters should be initialized to 
%   the initial potential. 
%   It returns a cluster graph that has the following fields:
%   - .clusterList: a list of the cluster beliefs in this graph. These entries
%                   have the following subfields:
%     - .var:  indices of variables in the specified cluster
%     - .card: cardinality of variables in the specified cluster
%     - .val:  the cluster's beliefs about these variables
%   - .edges: A cluster adjacency matrix where edges(i,j)=1 implies clusters i
%             and j share an edge.
%  
%   NOTE: The index of the cluster for each factor should be the same within the
%   clusterList as it is within the initial list of factors.  Thus, the cluster
%   for factor F(i) should be found in P.clusterList(i)
